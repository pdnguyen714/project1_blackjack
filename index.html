        <h3>Rules of the Game</h3>
        <p class="rulesList">
          Blackjack consists of two or more players. Each player is dealt two cards. Players each have the option to either "Hit" to draw a card, or "Stay" to keep the cards they have when it is their turn.
        </p>
        <p class="rulesList">
          The goal is to get to 21 points. The winner is the person who is closest
          to 21 points. If both players go over 21 points, they both lose.
          </p>
          <p class="rulesList">
            If one person goes over 21 and the other person is under 21, the person
          under 21 points wins.
        </p>
        <p class="rulesList">
          Jack - Queen - King = 10pts<br> 
          Ace = 1pt or 11pts - player's choice
